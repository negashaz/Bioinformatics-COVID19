# Protien Sequence Analysis of COVID-19 Genome

Viral proteins are proteins generated by a virus. As viruses hijack much of their host's cellular machinery to support their life cycle, they encode very few of their own genes; viral proteins are therefore generally structural components, for the viral envelope and capsid.

The global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has incurred over 265 million confirmed cases and more than 5.25 million fatalities since December of 2019 Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (SARS-CoVs) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (MERS-CoVs) of this family have emerged before and SARS-CoV-2 has emerged globally. The characterization of spike glycoproteins, polyproteins and other viral proteins from viruses is important for antiviral drug development.

For this project, I will try to identify those viral proteins in COVID-19 genome and compare the already emerged variants. I will be utilizing the National Center for Biotechnology Information’s (NCBI) Genbank database to obtain the sequential data and RCSB’s Protein Data Bank (PDB) for 3D visualization to perform a bioinformatic analysis, sequence alignment comparison of multiple sequences and modeling of MERS and SARS whole-genome sequencing.
## Deployment

To deploy this project run on a notebook enviroment

```bash
  open Protien_Sequence_Analysis_of_COVID-19_Genome.ipynb
```
Choose a notebook enviroment (E.g: https://colab.research.google.com/)
```bash
  open the contents of /Fasta Files and upload them to file directory
```
```bash
  open the contents of /PDB Files and upload them to file directory
```

Finally, you may run each cell to see real time output
